#DepSpace

DepSpace (Dependable Tuple Space) is fault and intrusion-tolerant secure tuple space implementation. The main objective of the system is to provide an extended tuple space abstraction that could be used to implement Byzantine fault tolerant applications. The system design is described in an [EuroSys'08 paper](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~bessani/publications/eurosys08-depspace.pdf).
